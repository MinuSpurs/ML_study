# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Self-Study

This repository contains my personal notes, experiments, and implementations created during my self-study of machine learning.

The goal of this study was to gain a deep understanding of fundamental ML concepts through implementation from scratch, hands-on practice, and experimentation with real datasets. The materials here cover both theory and code, and are organized as I explored different topics over time.

## âœ¨ Covered Topics

Some of the concepts and algorithms I studied include:

- Supervised Learning (Regression & Classification)
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Naive Bayes, K-NN
- Logistic Regression, SVM
- Neural Networks (from scratch and with PyTorch/Scikit-learn)
- Model Evaluation: Cross-validation, Confusion Matrix, ROC/AUC
- Feature Engineering and Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
- Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical)

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- This repository reflects a self-paced learning process. Some parts are exploratory or experimental.
- Many of the models are implemented from scratch in Python or Jupyter notebooks.
- Some exercises are adapted from MOOCs and books, including Andrew Ng's ML course and Hands-On ML with Scikit-Learn.
